# Project Part 4: Interpreter Assignment

## Overview

This program completes our interpreter assignment. Our program now has the
capabilities to check if-then, while-do, begin-end, and if-else statements.
The program can also be run from the terminal and programs can now be created.

## Reflection

This has been one of the most fun projects I've ever worked on! I can't believe that
we created an interpreter from the ground up, relatively speaking. I've had a blast
with this project all along the way and I think it had a great mix of challenge and
ease. Furthermore, I loved how we were encouraged to be creative with our solutions
and how we could personalize our prompt. Part of me would like to continue this
project by adding the capabilities to read a text document and interpret our code. I
would imagine this could be done by adding some logic to the interpreter class and
adding another command line argument for the file path. *Edit, just saw that it
can already do that :P

Considering all four parts, this one has been the most challenging. While I spend
close to the least amount of time on this part, I found myself the most challenged.
It was cool to see how working on this project prepared me for the parts ahead. The
first part consisted of me really trying to think through the program and how the
lexer tree was made. The part after was considering how that worked with the parser.
Each part helped my understanding with the last. Overall, I think this project is
VERY well spaced out and taught me a lot about how programming languages work.

## Compiling and Using

To run this part of the project, there are two ways. There are two test files:
```EvaluationTest.java``` and ```LexerTest.java```. Both tests will prove the validity
of all the features of the interpreter. To create your own code, you can run the
following command:

      $java Interpreter [-f file]

## Results

After running both test files, every test passes, proving that the interpreter works.
Also verified using the interpreter in the console.
