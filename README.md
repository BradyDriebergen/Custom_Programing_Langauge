# Project 5: IA Part 5

* Author: Brady Driebergen

## Overview

This program is an extension of our interpreter assignment project. This part had us
add scope to our programming language. This means that variables are limited to their
scope and the ones above it.


## Reflection

This project has been the funnest project I've worked on in my time here at Boise State.
Not only did I learn how programming languages work, but I also created one from nothing.
Granted, I didn't make a language from the ground up, but I feel good about the work I did
here. If I looked more into how to create programming languages, I'm confident I would have
a good shot at creating a language. As for this class, I can also say that this class became
my favorite class I've ever taken. I've enjoyed every assignment and project we've had. It
combined the perfect amount of complexity and difficulty to challenge and allow us to learn.
Even with projects like Scheme and PROLOG, I ended up learning a lot from them despite
wanting to put a hole through my computer screen. I really enjoyed this class and I hope my
future classes can be a fraction of how good this one was.

My favorite part of this project was implementing the if/then/while/begin logic. I feel like
that part of the project turned our programming language from a glorified calculator to an 
actual language. With this logic, we are able to compute more complex problems such as
Fibonacci sequence and finding two prime numbers. This language is still far from a real one, 
but It was still cool to see it grow. My least favorite part of this assignment is probably
this part's extra credit. I haven't given it a shot yet, but it looks fairly complicated. I
want to get the base done first and if I have time these next couple days, I'll happily use
the rest of my late days to see if I can get a good crack at it.


## Compiling and Using

To run this part of the project, there are two ways. There are two test files:
```EvaluationTest.java``` and ```LexerTest.java```. Both tests will prove the validity
of all the features of the interpreter. To create your own code, you can run the
following command:

      $java Interpreter [-f file]

## Results

After running both test files, every test passes, proving that the interpreter works.
Also verified using the interpreter in the console.
